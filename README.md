# gæmstone Game Engine

This **gæmstone** project, pronounced `/ɡɛmstoʊn/` (like "gem" but with the hard G from "game") is the latest installment in a series of attempts at building a game engine. It's written in C#, targeting cross-platform .NET 5, making heavy use of [Entity Component System][ECS] (ECS) design. This time, we're getting most inspiration from [flecs][flecs] and its author's [articles on ECS][medium].

This repository will likely replace [copygirl/gaemstone][old] once it becomes more functional.
